    2. Bootstrap

## Packages I used :-

## Overview :-

    A frontend SQL-Editor web App where a user can run queries and according to that dataset will be displayed. 
    
    As in this project only frontend is used so I have some static queries by default which a user can use it.
    
    A sample dataset(Customers Dataset) is there in the app for user reference in case he has to match the data.

     As I already mentioned that it is static so I have given 6 query button below the sql code editor box.
